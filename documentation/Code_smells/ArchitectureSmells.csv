Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell,Resolved ,if no ( reason )
group13,com.group13.academicplannerbackend.model,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [DeleteEventStatus]; [EventCategory; EventDTO; EventPriority; EventType; FixedEvent; RepeatEvent; RepititionType; User; UserMeta; VariableEvent; JwtResponse; ProfileStatus; Schedule]; [UpdateEventStatus]; [VerificationCode]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.25,NO,"We are following MVC architecture. Model folder only contains all the entities related to the database tables. Hence, they are not being detected as related, but they represent the ""Model"" part of MVC."
group13,com.group13.academicplannerbackend.repository,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [FixedEventRepository]; [ScheduleRepository]; [UserMetaRepository]; [UserRepository]; [VariableEventRepository]; [VerificationCodeRepository]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 1.0,NO,"Again, same reason as above. All the repositories are conventionally stored in ""repository"" folder for Spring Boot applications. Hence, they are in the same package."
group13,com.group13.academicplannerbackend.service.implementation,Scattered Functionality,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: com.group13.academicplannerbackend.model; com.group13.academicplannerbackend.repository.,NO,"It is detecting model and repository are realizing the same architecture concern. However, they have a different purpose. Models represent the entities of Spring application, while repository represent the abstraction from where we query the DB tables using JPA."
