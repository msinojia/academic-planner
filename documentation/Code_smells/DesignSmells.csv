group13,com.group13.academicplannerbackend.model,EventDTO,Broken Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields are declared in this class: id; name; startDate; endDate; startTime; endTime; isReschedulable; details; eventPriority; isRepeat; eventCategory; eventType,yes,
group13,com.group13.academicplannerbackend.model,FixedEvent,Broken Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields are declared in this class: id; name; startDate; endDate; startTime; endTime; isReschedulable; details; isRepeat; eventCategory; repeatEvent; user,yes,
group13,com.group13.academicplannerbackend.model,FixedEvent,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: FixedEvent; RepeatEvent,No,"The cyclic dependency between Fixed and Repeat events is for doing one-to-one mapping using JPA. We found documentation that says it is acceptable to have such a cyclic modularization in case of mappings between entities managed by JPA, hence we left it as such. Without it, there we faced an issue in saving tables in the correct structure."

group13,com.group13.academicplannerbackend.model,Schedule,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: VariableEvent; Schedule,No,Same reason as explained for cyclic modularization smell above,,,,,,,,,,,,
group13,com.group13.academicplannerbackend.model,User,Multifaceted Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1.0,No,"This smell is detected for 2 reasons. Firstly, UserMeta is stored in User for JPA mapping between these entities and the tool is detecting that User has multiple responsibilities due to this. Secondly, User is implementating UserDetails interface (provided by Spring Boot) for Spring Security, and the methods that are part of this interface are not interacting with other User methods (low cohesion). We feel that these reasons are valid since there is not an alternative way to do this.",,,,,,,,,,,,
